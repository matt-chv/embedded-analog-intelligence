* Artificial Intelligence is a myth
* Progress in automation a fact
* Machine Learning a fast moving field
* Defining intelligence is an [aporia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aporia)

Embedded Analog Intelligence aims at highlighting that what AI is about is:
* running from and to embedded systems mostly
* takes analog inputs (voice, images, sounds, ...) and aims at controlling systems with analog output
* is "intelligent" because any new control algorithm breakthrough is intelligent until outdated: computers which could do maths faster than humans were intelligent, until doing fast multiplication was not enough anymore...
