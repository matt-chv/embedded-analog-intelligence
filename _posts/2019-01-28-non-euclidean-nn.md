NN so far are leveraging euclidean geometry.
LiDaR and other sensor sources are providing voxels/ ... which are not euclidean

[LeCun arxiv publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.08097.pdf)

Frameworks so far:
* Splatnet
* Pointnet
* Pointnet++

### Questions:
* are DNN with RELU activation and mimicking neurons or more primitive cognitive networks?
* would DNN with more primitive or more advanced networks topologies and function provide better solutions for today's problems?
