Polanyi’s paradox, named in honour of the British-Hungarian philosopher Michael Polanyi, is the theory that human knowledge of how the world functions and capability are, to a large extent, beyond our explicit understanding.[source:wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polanyi’s_paradox)

## Questions
* If humans can’t explicit knowledge, how relevant are the “black box” criticism of AI?
* isn’t it more relevant to identify some medics and hope stems perform on those?
