```
Whereas it took millions of years for the first gliding vertebrate to evolve into a bird that could fly,
it took a mere 66 years from the Wright brothers’ first flight to Neil Armstrong’s “small step” onto the moon in 1969
```

```
it took a further four billion years for the first animals with primitive neurons to evolve, but a mere half a billion 
years more for natural selection to sculpt those first neurons into the human brain.
``` and less than 50 years for computers to beat humans at go game.


Time to:
*Flight:
   * 1901 Wilburd said powered flight would take another 50 years.
   * 1903 skeptics still said heavier than air flight not possible (same year the Wright brothers made it possible)
   * 1969 man landed on the moon
* Computer & Intelligence:
   * 4 Billion years from life to the first neurons
   * ??? computers cannot beat man to chess
   * 1997 Deep Blue beats Kasparov
   * 2017 Computer beast go master
   * 2018 self-taught computer beats `Computer go master`
```
a 1949 article in Popular Mechanics magazine declared:

… a calculator today is equipped with 18,000 vacuum tubes and weighs 30 tons, computers in the future may have only 1,000 vacuum tubes and perhaps weigh only half a ton.
