Recent home robot failures:
* [Anki](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/home-robots/consumer-robotics-company-anki-abruptly-shuts-down)
* [Jibo](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/home-robots/jibo-is-probably-totally-dead-now)
* [Kuri](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/home-robots/mayfield-robotics-cancels-kuri-social-home-robot)

```
Like the Newton, Jibo, Kuri, and Cozmo were courageous trailblazers into a virtually unknown use-case. Like the Newton, these products were conceived based on some research but also on a lot of intuition. And like the Newton, the first generation of social home robots ended up not making much sense to consumers.

Lessons Learned
* Need the ability to connect between conversations 
* Need artistic flair and contribution beyond engineering
* Embodiment does create emotional bonds
* Design matters

## Questions:
* Who will dare to try again and when?
