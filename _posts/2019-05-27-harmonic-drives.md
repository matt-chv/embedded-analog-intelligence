[Notes from White paper](https://www.harmonicdrive.net/media/1770/hdllc-ebook20150326.pdf)
A repeatability specification of ± 0.02 mm for a robot with a 700-mm reach 
translates to an angular repeatability of just ± 5.9 arc-sec at the base axis. 

```
Some conventional spur or planetary gears can be
accurate for single-direction positioning, but they
fall short in terms of repeatability, which can present
system control issues. The main culprit is backlash, a
feature that is deliberately designed into these gears to
provide proper tooth clearance, minimize tooth wear,
and allow the drives to operate smoothly. Backlash has
a negative impact on robot performance and is most
significant when present in the first and second axes

### Question
* How can we compare all drives aspects
