>AprilTags are conceptually similar to QR Codes, in that they are a type of two-dimensional bar code. However, they are designed to encode far smaller data 
>payloads (between 4 and 12 bits), allowing them to be detected more robustly
>and from longer ranges. Further, they are designed for high localization accuracyâ€” you can compute the precise 3D position of the AprilTag with respect to the camera.
