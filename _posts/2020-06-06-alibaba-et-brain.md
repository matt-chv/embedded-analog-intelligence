> “Let’s say we are building a deep learning algorithm to detect this corn. And we take lots of pictures of kernels to give it. Say we pick those kernels in central Illinois.

Meanwhile, this other farm harvested three days later in a field five miles away; it’s the same hybrid, but it also looks different.
