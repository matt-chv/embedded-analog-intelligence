[Lidar startup goes public, makes founder a billionaire](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/12/lidar-startup-goes-public-makes-founder-a-billionaire/)

>[..]Luminar had a major win in May when it signed a deal with Volvo to supply lidar sensors for vehicles starting in 2022. 
> It was one of the first such deals in the industry.
> More recently, Luminar struck a deal to supply lidar sensors to Mobileye, the Intel subsidiary that supplies many of 
> the camera-based driver assistance systems in today's cars

> While industry leader Velodyne has traditionally made 360-degree spinning units designed to sit on a vehicle roof, 
> Luminar's sensors are fixed in place and cover a 120 degree horizontal field of view in front of a vehicle.
> Long range is viewed as essential for advanced self-driving systems, and Luminar claims its lidar has an industry-leading 
> range of 250 meters. One reason for this is that its lasers operate at an unusual frequency. Most lidar sensors operate at around 900nm
