[arxiv source](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11102)
How OracleNet (a RNN) is demonstrated to outperform A* or RRT* (which get exponentially computationally expensive with dimensions and clutter)
for trajectory planning.

Oracle is A* algorithm is used to train OracleNet

## Question: 
* What is the complexity of duplicating those findings?
