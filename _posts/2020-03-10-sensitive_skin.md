```Tests show that the sensor can detect humans from up to 30 centimeters away. It has an accuracy of 90 percent when on a flat surface. However, the electric and magnetic fields become weaker and more dispersed when the sensor is laid over 
a curved surface. Therefore, the sensorâ€™s accuracy decreases as the underlying surface becomes increasingly curved.```
