While most cameras uses in embedded systems today are CMOS based (the technology havin superseded CCD already a few decade ago) they are about to be replaced by QDots based cameras.

Key benefits of QDots: 
* smaller pixel sizes
* ability of hyperspectral imaging
Technology limitation today:
- lower Quantuum Efficiency

Generic introduction from [IEEE](https://spectrum.ieee.org/consumer-electronics/audiovideo/move-over-cmos-here-come-snapshots-by-quantum-dots)

### Questions:
* shutter control - same or different?
* background noise ?
