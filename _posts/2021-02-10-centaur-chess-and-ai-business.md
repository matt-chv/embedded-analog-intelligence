What can we learn from centaur chess and the fight between human Stenographers and AI.

[Centaur Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_chess) 
>  is a form of chess in which each human player uses a computer chess program to explore the possible results of candidate moves.(...)(it) was introduced for the first time by grandmaster Garry Kasparov, with the aim of bringing together human and computer skills.

from [Stenographer's AI's fears](https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1009577/Test%20of%20Character:%20A%20Stenographer%E2%80%99s%20AI%20Fears)
> (a professional stenographer) will carefully edit out broken sentences while dignitaries are speaking, and has studiously refreshed herself on any rare words that are likely to come up to avoid mistakes. Wangâ€™s software faithfully records every utterance, sometimes resulting in unreadable passages, and will stumble on some jargon.

Possibly that:

1. AI allows humans to be freed from mundane tasks: check all possible mistakes of chess, or typing all the words for the transcripts
2. AI will require humans to either provide entertainment (human strategy is most likely more enjoyable for other spectators) or to fine tune the text (remove utterance and straighten text when words are not clear)
