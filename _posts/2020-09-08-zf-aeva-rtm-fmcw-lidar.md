# First FMCW LiDAR to Automotive Production
[PressRelease](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200908005368/en/Aeva-and-ZF-Bring-First-FMCW-LiDAR-to-Automotive-Production)

>Unlike other LiDAR technologies, Aeva’s 4D LiDAR-on-chip uses a continuous laser beam to measure the change in frequency of the waveform 
>as it reflects off of an object. This allows it to detect an object’s range and instant velocity simultaneously beyond 300 meters at high 
>accuracy. Aeva’s 4D LiDAR is also completely free of interference from other sensors or sunlight and it operates at only fractions of the 
>optical power typically required to achieve long range performance. All of which are critical hurdles that have previously slowed the broad 
>adoption of automotive LiDAR.

## Question:

* How could FMCW be below levels required for long range
