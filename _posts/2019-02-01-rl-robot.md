#RL for robot

from [this article](https://www.therobotreport.com/reinforcement-learning-industrial-robotics/)

"Just to name two recently popularized use cases for both control methods: 
* Boston Dynamics is known for deploying conventional feedback control laws (more precisely Funnel Control) for all its well-known demonstrations. 
* Google, on the other hand, has shown that RL is capable to arrive at a robot controller for bin picking simply through trial and error. 
However, several months of training on a robot farm were required to achieve the required control performance."
