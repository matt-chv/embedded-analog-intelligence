## Key differences between the (~3888) LiDaRs:

* beam steering (9)
* Time of flight measurement (3)
* Optics (144)

Notes: 
beam steering (9):
    - Solid state (3) : none , DMD in TX, DMD in RX path 
    - Rotating Mirrors (3) : polygon, galvano, 
* Time of flight measurement (3): PMCW, FMCW, AMCW
* Optics (144):
    - wavelength (2) : 905, 1550, 
    - Front-End dimensions (3) : (respectively #RX, #TX): 1x1, few x few, few x many
    - Laser diode technology (2): edge emiting or VCSEL
        - LD bias circuitry (2)
    - Photo diode technology (3) : MPPC/SiPM, APD, Pin
        - PD bias circuitry (2)

## beam steering

* Non-Mecanical (aka solid-state)
    - MEMS - should be DMD (Digital Micro Mirror) - 
    - Flash LiDaR - a very powerful Laser illuminates the entire scene and an array of photodetectors senses the return light.
    - OPA - (Optical phase array) -  In an OPA system, an optical phase modulator controls the speed
of light passing through the lens.
* Mecanical
    - polygon-beam-scanners
    - galvano scanner ([polygon vs galvano](https://www.nidec-copal-electronics.com/us/featuring/lidar-polygon/vs_galvo/))
    - motorized with encoders

## ToF measurement:
* PB-ToF (or PMCW): pulse based or pseudo-random sequences
* FMCW-ToF: Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave
* AMCW-ToF: Amplitude Modulated Contiuous Wave

----

### PB-ToF (pulse based time of flight) or PMCW

* Simple version: simple pulse
* dual-slope or dual gate as in [1 - doi: 10.3390/s18061679](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6022202/) or [2 - doi=10.1.1.579.1245](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.579.1245&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
* Advanced version - pseudorandom modulation continuous-wave (PMCW): with multiple pulse sent with a pseudo-random sequence.

----

### FMCW-ToF

FMCW: Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave for Time of flight measurement

----

### AMCW-ToF

Amplitude Modulated Continuous Wave Time of Flight 

Notes:
* [error analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6022202/)

## Optics

* Wavelengthts
* Front-End dimensions
* Opto-electronics

----

### Wavelengths

905nm and 1550nm are the dominant wavelength

|      | 905nm | 1550 nm |
|------|-------|---------|
| Pros |       |         |
| Cons |       |         |

----

## Front-End dimensions

* 1x1: single pixel TX, single pixel RX
* few x few : often multiple discrete LD and discrete LD
* few x many : eitehr 1x or few discrete LD and an integrated array of photos sensors

----

## Laser diode

* Opto-electronic Technology
* Electronic bias circuitry (2)

----

## Photo diode

* Opto-electronic Technology:
    - MPPC/SiPM
    - APD
    - Pin
* Electronic bias circuitry (2)

Notes: p-i-n silicon detectors vs avalanche photodiodes or silicon photomultipliers
CWFM-ToF can use coherent detection can be used with pin diodes which are significantly cheaper than APD often used in PB-ToF.

## Atmospheric considerations

test:
$$x_{1,2} = {-b\pm\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a}.$$
[some fundamentals](https://www.laserfocusworld.com/lasers-sources/article/16548115/lidar-a-photonics-guide-to-the-autonomous-vehicle-market)
$$ P=P_0 * rho * A0/(pi*R2) *eta * exp(-2*gamma*R) $$
Where: 
* η0 is the detection optics' spectral transmission, 
* γ is the atmospheric extinction coefficient.
