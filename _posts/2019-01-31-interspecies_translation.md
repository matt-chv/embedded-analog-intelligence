As Machine Learning acquires the ability to translate many different languages in real-time, the boundary will soon be beyond the realm of human languages.

A recent article in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-018-0303-6), shows how deep learning can be used to decipher ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) of mice and of their insights into the emotional state.

When will we be able to achieve a similar feat with dolphins?
