## Safety Related Sensors (IEC 62998)

### Scope

>safety related sensors and sensor systems used for protection of persons with special
attention to systematics
> - protection of persons is to be performed by using sensors, and
> - standards for functional safety of electrical control systems address sensor(s) as subsystem or
subsystem element, and
> - product specific sensor standards (e.g. IEC 61496 , IEC 60947-5-2) do not contain all necessary
provisions, or product specific sensor standards are not developed.

## FUSION

>3.15.3 - fusion
> the act or process of combining or associating data or information regarding one or more entities 
> considered in an explicit or implicit knowledge framework to improve oneâ€™s capability (or provide a
> new capability) for detection, identification, or characterization of that entity 

> 3.15.1 - alignment
> - processing of SRS measurements to achieve a common time base and a common spatial
> reference
> 3.15.2 - diversity
> different means of performing a required function Note to entry: Diversity may be achieved by
> different physical methods or different design approaches. [SOURCE: IEC 61508-4:2010, 3.3.7]
