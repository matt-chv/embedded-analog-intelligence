# Toshiba’s Light Sensor Paves the Way for Cheap Lidar

> Toshiba has developed a compact, highly efficient silicon photo-multiplier (SiPM) that enables 
> non-coaxial Lidar to employ off-the-shelf camera lenses to lower costs and help bring about solid-state, high-resolution Lidar.

> The technology boosts light-cell efficiency, enables high-res Lidar using commercial camera lenses
