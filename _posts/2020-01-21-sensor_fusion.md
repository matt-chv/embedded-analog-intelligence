sensor fusion for *layman*: learning to ride a bike is learning to fuse information from visual cortex and vestibular to keep :
* balance 
* while keeping the bike away from traffic and static obstacles


Sensor fusion for *engineers*: the branch of computer science and associated algorithms used to combined multiple sensor data to reduce uncertainty inherent to each sensor output.
Intro
There are 2 dimensions to sensor fusion:

Level (from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor_fusion#Levels)): 
* level 0: data alignement 
* level 1:  Entity assessment (e.g. signal/feature/object)

Type:
* Competitive: dual channel approach ( 2 overlaping cameras)
* Complementary: appending overlapping sensor data (e.g. front and rear camera)
* Cooperative: complemntary to add more incormation (2 cameras to rnablr stereoscopic views)
