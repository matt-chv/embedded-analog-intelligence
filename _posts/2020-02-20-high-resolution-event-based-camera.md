#Prophesee’s Event-Based Camera Reaches High Resolution

> Embedded vision startup Prophesee teams with Sony to shrink its pixel size to less than 5 micrometers
> [...] Paris-based startup Prophesee has been developing and selling event-based vision sensors since 2016, 
> but the applications for their chips were limited to systems that needed only VGA resolution
> “Using the Sony process, which is probably the most advanced process, we managed to shrink the pixel pitch down to 4.86 micrometers” 
> from their previous 15 micrometers, says Luca Verre, the company’s cofounder and CEO.
> The resulting 1280 x 720 HD event-based imager is suitable for a much wider range of applications, including surveillance and monitoring, 
> augmented reality, virtual reality, and drones.
