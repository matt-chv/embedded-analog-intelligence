Biologists study many networks, not just neural networks.

Current thinking is that network perform tasks by controlling edges.

One such example is how blood flow is controlled through the network of blood vessels to achieve different tasks: thinking, walking, digesting, ...
Other examples is how mechanical networks in proteins can perform multiple functions (aka [protein moonlighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_moonlighting) )

The networks are modelled with either springs or resistors and "programmed"

The findings are 

> Our finding that a disordered network topology allows for tunability may have relevance to real biological networks. For example, the development of certain vascular structures within animals is characterized by the initial appearance of a tightly meshed disordered network of veins (the vascular plexus) that is subsequently pruned and tuned to its function (26). The initial disordered network may be a prerequisite of the great variability and versatility seen in natural networks.

### Questions:
* Can this be leveraged for designs of NN? If so, how?
