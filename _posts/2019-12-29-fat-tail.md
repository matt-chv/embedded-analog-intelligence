Notes from this [article](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-end-of-scale/)

[Primary publication - none]()

20th century is defined for business as the quest for scale: fixed costs can be divided over larger volumes.

AI/ML takes the cost for entering a new market (collecting enough information to be relevant), to the point where it is nearly neglictable.

As a consequence a new challenger is competitive against an incumbent as it does not have the previous investements to recover.

Examples:
* [Stripe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripe_(company)) is competing against big banks
* [Airbnb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb) vs hotel chains
	
### Questions:
* Interesting idea, but how much data would one need to compete against Google, what would be the cost of such data acquisition?
