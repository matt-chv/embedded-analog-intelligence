# ISO/IEC Guide 51
[ISO/IEC GUIDE 51:2014 ](https://www.iso.org/standard/53940.html)
Safety aspects — Guidelines for their inclusion in standards
```
provides requirements and recommendations for the drafters of standards for the inclusion of safety aspects in standards
```

* type A: Fundamental safety standards applicable to *all machinery*. Type A standards deal with basic concepts, principles for design, and general aspects.
* type B: Standards applicable to a *wide range of machinery*, type B is divided in two categories:

B1: Specific safety aspects (i.e. safey distance, surface temperature, noise, ...)
B2: Safety related devices (i.e. two-hand controls, interlokcing devices, pressure sentitive devices, ...)

* type C: Detailed standards applicable to a *specific machine* or a particular group of machines
