notes from [article](https://www.inceptivemind.com/dexterous-robotic-hand-move-same-human-hand/7436/)
A London-based robotic company, [Shadow Robot](https://www.shadowrobot.com/products/dexterous-hand/) crafted a robotic hand which is considered to be one of the best robotic hands ever created. 
It named as “Dexterous Hand”.

It takes over a decade for making, the robotic hand has 24 joints that are driven by 20 motors. 

As well as absolute position sensing for each joint the Hand includes force sensing for each actuator, tactile sensing on fingertips,
temperature and motor current and voltage sensing. 
All of this data is made available to the user from 100Hz and up to 1kHz via a high bandwidth EtherCAT interface.
Supporting this high frequency for data is the fast movement of the hand – from open to closed in 0.5 seconds.


### Questions:
* What is the min torque/force the hand can exerce?
