Intelligence is for me is a force which aims at maximising our future options, which includes:
* The ability to learn about models of our environment 
* The ability to run "thoughts experiments" to determine the outcome of actions prior to engaging in those actions within a given time horizon
* Ranking the possible outcomes based on their desired values and minimising the cost (energy, ...) associated with the selected action path
* Engaging in the real world, being able to act as planned and adjusting when needed.

While this has so far failed to gain traction, there is a lot of interesting ideas which can be derived from An equation for intelligence from Wissner-Gross: 

F = T ∇ Sτ

Which  was proposed in [Physical Reviews in 2013](https://www.alexwg.org/publications/PhysRevLett_110-168702.pdf)

While this is interesting, there are some obvious limitations:
* whether intelligence is always and exclusively utilitarian? 
> What about arts, though patrons have often been needed, artists probably would exists without them so the main motivation of artists cannot be said to be purely utilitarian? 
And since we are studying AI, may as well note the first AI generated painting sold at Christies in October 2018 [here](https://www.christies.com/features/A-collaboration-between-two-artists-one-human-one-a-machine-9332-1.aspx)
 or the recently released AI pop music album ([hello world](https://phys.org/news/2018-10-ai-album-ushers-musical-era.html) )...

Last but not least, what is creativity ?
