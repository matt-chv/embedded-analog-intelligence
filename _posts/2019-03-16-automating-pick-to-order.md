Company: NewIcon

Previously, NewIcon employed linear robots in its medication retrieval systems. 
Since 2010, however, the company has been using DENSO robots, which offer more axes for faster storage and retrieval 
as well as light-weight components in a compact housing. NewIcon also opted for DENSO because DENSOÂ´s open architecture 
could be flexibly integrated with its existing software and machine vision system.
