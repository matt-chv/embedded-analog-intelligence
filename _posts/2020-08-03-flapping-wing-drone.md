# Drone with flapping wings

While most drones have spinning motors, flapping-wing robot wich mimic birds is difficult because wings move back and forth at high speed 
which means a complex transmission system, which leads to weight and energy efficiencies penalties.

In Science Robotics roboticists described a new design for a flapping-wing robot:
