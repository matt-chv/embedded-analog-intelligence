## Sensor Fusion 

> Leaning to ride a bike is often the human first sensor fusion experience

## Sensor Fusion: the 3 C's of fusion

* Competitive: dual channel approach ( 2 overlaping cameras)
* Complementary: appending overlapping sensor data (e.g. front and rear camera)
* Cooperative: complemntary to add more incormation (2 cameras to rnablr stereoscopic views)

Notes: Remmeber to say something funny here: 3C of F has nothing to do with the 3 coins in the fountain from Sinatra (1954 movie)

## Sensor Fusion: the 5 Levels of fusion

0. Data alignment
1. Entity assessment (e.g. signal/feature/object).
Tracking and object detection/recognition/identification
2. Situation assessment
3. Impact assessment
4. Process refinement (i.e. sensor management)
5. User refinement
